## HR Analytics Overview

### Introduction
This analytics project was undertaken to investigate employee attrition within an organization. The primary objective was to identify key factors influencing attrition and recommend actionable solutions to mitigate it. The project followed a structured approach involving project scoping, data collection and cleaning, visualization through Power BI, reporting key insights, implementing strategies, and monitoring outcomes.

### Project Objectives

• Analyze the IBM HR Dataset

• Prepare and clean the dataset for analysis

• Use Power BI to visualize and interpret attrition trends, including:

   • Attrition by Education Field

   • Attrition by Age Group

   • Attrition by Job Role

   • Attrition by Job Role and Job Satisfaction

   • Employee tenure (Years at Company)

### Dashboard Insights
Separate dashboards were created for male and female employees to observe gender-based attrition patterns.


### Key Findings from HR Attrition Analysis

• The dataset includes data for 1,470 employees across multiple departments and job roles.

• Average salary: ₹6.5K

• Average age: 37 years

• Average tenure: 7 years

• Attrition rate: 237 employees (16% of total workforce)

• Highest attrition observed among employees aged 26–35, particularly males (70 individuals, 19.02%).

Insight: This group had an average salary of ₹4.82K, which may contribute to their decision to leave.

The Research & Development department faced the highest attrition (133 employees), notably among Library Technicians and Research Scientists.

Insight: Their average salary was ₹3.24K, possibly explaining the high turnover.

Root Causes and Recommended Solutions

• Age -	Younger employees exhibit higher attrition rates	Provide career development programs to retain younger talent.
• Department - R&D experiences the highest attrition	Address workload, communication gaps, and limited growth opportunities.
• Job Role - Laboratory Technicians face the highest attrition	Conduct exit interviews or surveys to identify and resolve underlying concerns.

### Conclusion
• Organizations can significantly reduce attrition and enhance employee satisfaction by taking a data-driven approach to HR management.

• By closely analyzing attrition trends and workforce dynamics, companies can adapt their HR policies, improve compensation and benefits, and invest in employee development.
